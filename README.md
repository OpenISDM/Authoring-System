# Authoring System

Today, disaster historical records are typically written in natural language text together with tables, graphs, etc. In their current form, disaster records have two shortcomings. Data and information may be inconsistent and incomplete, and such defects take time and effort to uncover.

Authoring System is a cloud-based system for generation of disaster reports based data captured via DiReCTs. It carries out post-collection data quality control to improved the completeness and consistency of data on disasters and emergencies.  
Disaster records produced with the help of the system can be read and processed by search, analysis, simulation and visualization tools for purposes such as developing better response strategies, providing decision support during emergencies, post-disaster analysis, and so on. It can also assist authors to write reports on the disaster based on the captured data and information.
